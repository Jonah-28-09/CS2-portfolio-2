                    <p class="top_space_large">
                        I am a sophomore and a part of the class of 2028. My name is Jonah.
                    </p>

                    <p class="top_space">
                        Learning is a big part of who I am, as I have mastered none of my 
                        current hobbies. I am learning guitar (along with some other instruments)
                        and I play in a band called <em>Carrey Powers</em>. We create and cover rock music 
                        and have a lot of fun playing and learning together. It is 
                        also really great "team building" as we have to agree on everything we do.
                    </p>

                        <em>"A band is like a marriage, and if you're in a marriage with someone, and you 
                        lose yourself in that marriage, the relationship is over, really,"</em> <strong>- Richie Sombora</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p class="top_space_large">
                       I am extremely interested in studying computer science, and specifically AI. I find it to be 
                        extremely interesting and I believe that AI is the future. It is not something that should scare people 
                        and it certainly is not something that people should worry about. It makes us more efficient as a society, 
                        and if it takes jobs from people, those people will adapt. It will not be an easy or quick change 
                        for us, but it will be definite and sure.

                        I also play and am learning rugby. It is exciting to feel improvements after each practice and game with my team. 
                        I am not even close to the best on the team, however it is extremely fun to learn and to build 
                        connections with my teammates.

                                I currently work in the garden center department of Pemberton
                                Farms. That means I am in the <em>outside</em> portion of the store.
                                right now for Christmas time, I am helping to sell trees to families.
                                Working at Pemberton Farms means working with a team as one. It means
                                a lot of socializing as well as team building.

                                In addition to talking to families, I also help the families pick out 
                                this years Christmas tree for their house. I give recommendations based on what
                                they expressed they want for their home, and I explain the difference between the 
                                two kinds of trees we sell. Once they pick out their tree, I carry to the Christmas
                                tree baler (the net chute) to be netted up and loaded on the car. Then I carry it to
                                the customer's car and find a new family to help.

                                        I started playing Rugby freshman year thanks to one of my best friends.
                                        It is extremely fun and I really enjoy the game. I play second row as a forward (lock)
                                        (number 4/5).

                                        I played soccer for about 9 years from 3-12. Quite frankly I hate the game. I hate watching
                                    and playing it. I was my team's goalie.

                                        I played flag football for about 8 years from 5-13. Football is amazing, it's fun to watch, 
                                        and fun to play. I was usually my team's center.
